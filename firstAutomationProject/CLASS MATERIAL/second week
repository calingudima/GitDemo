control  flow statements

loops - control flow programming that will help us execute the code - repeatedly, as many times as we need it too.

 FOR LOOP - a loop that helps to iterate over the object as many times as needed. It goes through a cycle and gets executed.


 for number in range(1, 5):   # 0 is number 1 in the list, another example: for number in range(5) - will print 5 times, from 0 zero to 4 four.
     print("Tojtech")
     print("lalala", number)  # will print the representation of the number of each line.



# for number in range(30):
#     print("Tojtech", number)
#     if number == 2:
#         print("hgiuyhkj")  # at 9:13    ###### BREAK will stop the loop at a certain nr.
#         break
